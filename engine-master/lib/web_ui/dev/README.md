## What's `felt`?
`felt` stands for "Flutter Engine Local Tester". It's a cli tool that aims to make development in the Flutter web engine more productive and pleasant.

## What can `felt` do?
`felt` supports multiple commands as follows:

1. **`felt check-licenses`**: Checks that all Dart and JS source code files contain the correct license headers.
2. **`felt test`**: Runs all or some tests depending on the passed arguments.
3. **`felt build`**: Builds the engine locally so it can be used by Flutter apps. It also supports a watch mode for more convenience.

You could also run `felt help` or `felt help <command>` to get more information about the available commands and arguments.

## How can I use `felt`?
Once you have your local copy of the engine [setup](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Setting-up-the-Engine-development-environment), it's recommended that you add `/path/to/engine/src/flutter/lib/web_ui/dev` to your `PATH`.
Then you would be able to use the `felt` tool from anywhere:
```
felt check-licenses
```
or:
```
felt build --watch
```

If you don't want to add `felt` to your path, you can still invoke it using a relative path like `./web_ui/dev/felt <command>`

## Speeding up your builds
You can speed up your builds by using more CPU cores. Pass `-j` to specify the desired level of parallelism, like so:
```
felt build [-w] -j 100
```
If you are a Google employee, you can use an internal instance of Goma to parallelize your builds. Because Goma compiles code on remote servers, this option is effective even on low-powered laptops.

## Running web engine tests
To run all tests on Chrome:

```
felt test
```

To run tests on Firefox (this will work only on a Linux device):

```
felt test --browser=firefox
```

For Chrome and Firefox, the tests run on a version locked on the [browser_lock.yaml](https://github.com/flutter/engine/blob/master/lib/web_ui/dev/browser_lock.yaml). In order to use another version, add the version argument:

```
felt test --browser=firefox --firefox-version=70.0.1
```

To run tests on Safari use the following command. It works on MacOS devices and it uses the Safari installed on the OS. Currently there is no option for using another Safari version.

```
felt test --browser=safari
```

To run a single test:
```
felt test test/golden_tests/engine/canvas_golden_test.dart
```

To debug a test on Chrome:
```
felt test --debug test/golden_tests/engine/canvas_golden_test.dart
```

## Configuration files

`browser_lock.yaml` contains the version of browsers we use to test Flutter for
web. Versions are not automatically updated whenever a new release is available.
Instead, we update this file manually once in a while.

`goldens_lock.yaml` refers to a revision in the https://github.com/flutter/goldens
repo. Screenshot tests are compared with the golden files at that revision.
When making engine changes that affect screenshots, first submit a PR to
flutter/goldens updating the screenshots. Then update this file pointing to
the new revision.

## Developing the `felt` tool
If you are making changes in the `felt` tool itself, you need to be aware of Dart snapshots. We create a Dart snapshot of the `felt` tool to make the startup faster.

To make sure you are running the `felt` tool with your changes included, you would need to stop using the snapshot. This can be achived through the environment variable `FELT_USE_SNAPSHOT`:

```
FELT_USE_SNAPSHOT=false felt <command>
```
or
```
FELT_USE_SNAPSHOT=0 felt <command>
```

_**Note**: if `FELT_USE_SNAPSHOT` is omitted or has any value other than "false" or "0", the snapshot mode will be enabled._
