For an introduction to contributing to Flutter, see [our contributor
guide][contrib_guide].

For specific instructions regarding building Flutter's engine, see [Setting up
the Engine development environment][engine_dev_setup] on our wiki. Those
instructions are part of the broader onboarding instructions described in the
contributing guide.

### Style

The Flutter engine follows Google style for the languages it uses:
- [C++](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)
- [Objective-C](https://google.github.io/styleguide/objcguide.html) (including
  [Objective-C++](https://google.github.io/styleguide/objcguide.html#objective-c))
- [Java](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)

C++ and Objective-C/C++ files are formatted with `clang-format`, and GN files with `gn format`.
