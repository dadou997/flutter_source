  ///             rendering in Flutter, embedders usually add a placeholder
  ///             over the contents in which Flutter is going to render when
  ///             Flutter is first initialized. This callback may be used as
  ///             a signal to remove that placeholder. The callback is
  ///             executed on the render task runner and not the platform
  ///             task runner. It is the embedder's responsibility to
  ///             re-thread as necessary.

  ///             on-screen.
  ///
  /// @attention  This method must only be called once per texture. When the

  ///             with the specified texture identifier is sufficient to
  ///             make Flutter re-render the frame with the updated texture
  ///             composited in-line.

  ///             Typically, Flutter will only render a frame if there is an
  ///             updated layer tree. However, in cases where the layer tree
  ///             is static but one of the externally composited textures

  ///             notify the rasterizer to render a new frame. In such
  ///             cases, the existing layer tree may be reused with the
  ///             frame re-composited with all updated external textures.
  ///             Unlike the calls to register and unregister the texture,
  ///             this call must be made each time a new texture frame is
