 *   <li>Once an {@link Activity} is created, and its associated {@link FlutterEngine} is
 *   executing Dart code, the {@link Activity} should invoke
 *   {@link #attachToActivity(Activity, Lifecycle)}. At this point the {@link FlutterEngine}
 *   is considered "attached" to the {@link Activity} and all {@link ActivityAware} plugins
 *   are given access to the {@link Activity}.</li>
 *   <li>Just before an attached {@link Activity} is destroyed for configuration change purposes,
 *   that {@link Activity} should invoke {@link #detachFromActivityForConfigChanges()}, giving
 *   each {@link ActivityAware} plugin an opportunity to clean up its references before the
 *   {@link Activity is destroyed}.</li>
 *   <li>When an {@link Activity} is recreated after configuration changes, that {@link Activity}
 *   should invoke {@link #reattachToActivityAfterConfigChange(Activity)} so that all
 *   {@link ActivityAware} plugins can re-establish references to the {@link Activity}.</li>
 *   <li>When an {@link Activity} is destroyed for non-configuration-change purposes, or when
 *   the {@link Activity} is no longer interested in displaying a {@link FlutterEngine}'s content,
 *   the {@link Activity} should invoke {@link #detachFromActivity()}.</li>
 * </ol>
 * The attached {@link Activity} should also forward all {@link Activity} calls that this
 * {@code ActivityControlSurface} supports, e.g.,
 * {@link #onRequestPermissionsResult(int, String[], int[])}. These forwarded calls are made
 * available to all {@link ActivityAware} plugins that are added to the attached {@link FlutterEngine}.
