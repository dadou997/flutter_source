   * <p>
   * The typical return value for this method is {@code false}. When the return value is
   * {@code false}, the following can happen:
   * <ol>
   *   <li>Splash {@code View} begins transitioning to the Flutter UI.
   *   <li>A configuration change occurs, like an orientation change, and the {@code Activity}
   *   is re-created, along with the {@code View} hierarchy.
   *   <li>The remainder of the splash transition is skipped and the Flutter UI is displayed.
   * </ol>
   * In the vast majority of cases, skipping a little bit of the splash transition should be
   * acceptable. Most users will never experience such a situation, and those that do are
   * unlikely to notice the visual artifact. However, a workaround is available for those
   * developers who need it.
   * <p>
   * Returning {@code true} from this method will cause the given splash {@code View} to be
   * displayed in the {@code View} hierarchy, even if Flutter has already rendered its first
   * frame. It is then the responsibility of the splash {@code View} to remember its previous
   * transition progress, restart any animations, and then trigger its completion callback
   * when appropriate. It is also the responsibility of the splash {@code View} to immediately
   * invoke the completion callback if it has already completed its transition. By meeting
   * these requirements, and returning {@code true} from this method, the splash screen
   * experience will be completely seamless, including configuration changes.
